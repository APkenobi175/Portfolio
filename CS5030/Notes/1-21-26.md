## Review of Last Class

1. Remember that accessing a 2d array by column is slower than accessing by row due to memory layout. row[a][0] to row[a][8] is in the same memory block, but row[0][a] to row[8][a] is not, and that is why column access is slower. When doing column access, you are getting data from different memory blocks, which means you aren't utilizing cache as well. thats called a cache miss, whereas row access you miss twice and get 8 accesses in a row, which is a cache hit.

2. Also remember that speedup of a parrelel program is how much faster it is than a serial program.

3. A non deterministic parralel program means that the output can vary and be out of order. One of the solutions to this is to use "busy-waiting", which is where a thread will wait until it is safe or its turn to use a shared resource. This will allow the threads to finish in the order that you want them too, and they won't overwrite shared data.

4. If it takes 10 cycles to load a single 64 bit word, then you can use 10 memory banks to load 1 word per cycle. Using memory banks allows you to load multiple sections of a single 64 bit word in parallel, which increases memory bandwidth.
