# RESTful Routing

### What Is RESTful Routing?

RESTful routing is an architectural style for designing web applications that follow the principles of **Representational State Transfer (REST)**.

### What Is REST?

REST is an approach to building networked applications that rely on **HTTP methods** and a consistent structure to create well-organized, scalable, and maintainable APIs.

In RESTful routing, the application defines endpoints that perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources using these HTTP methods:

* **GET** – Retrieve data from the server
* **POST** – Create a new resource on the server
* **PUT** – Update an existing resource
* **DELETE** – Remove a resource from the server

Each endpoint corresponds to a specific resource and action.
The **HTTP method** and **URL path** together define what operation the server should perform.
Responses include **HTTP status codes** such as `200 OK`, `201 Created`, or `404 Not Found`.

**In short:** RESTful routing simplifies and standardizes API design.

# Migrations

### What Are Migrations?

Migrations are Django’s way of updating and managing your database schema as your models change.

To generate migration files based on changes to your models:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

To apply those migrations and update the actual database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This process ensures your database structure matches your Django models.

# Updating the Database with JavaScript

### Using JavaScript to Update Data

You can use JavaScript to update the database when users interact with elements like checkboxes:

```js
for (let checkbox of document.querySelectorAll("input[type=checkbox]")) {
    checkbox.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
        // TODO: Make a fetch() request to update the todo
    });
}
```

This event listener detects when a checkbox changes state and triggers a function to send data to the server.

#### Important Notes:

* HTML attribute names use **dashes** (e.g., `data-todo-id`), but in JavaScript they’re accessed with **camelCase** (`dataset.todoId`).
* HTML is **case-insensitive**, so attribute naming doesn’t matter there, but JavaScript treats it precisely.

Example:

```js
for (let checkbox of document.querySelectorAll("input[type=checkbox]")) {
    checkbox.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
        console.log(e.target.dataset.todoId);
    });
}
```

In Django, most front-end interactions use **POST** and **GET** requests, keeping with RESTful routing principles.

### Other Key Information (from Quizzes)

* **Rendering:** Reading a file’s bytes and converting them into a Python string to send in the response.
* **Forms:** Must have a `name` attribute to send information to the server.
* **Buttons:** Inside a form, they submit the form to the server by default.
* **Template Tags:** In Django templates, special logic is written using tags like:

{% raw %}

```
{% tag_name %}
```

{% endraw %}
