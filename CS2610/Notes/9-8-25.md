# Django

### What is a Framework

A framework is a pre established and reusable set of libraries tools and guidlines that provide a foundation for building applications. 

A web framework is a software framework designed to aid developers in building web applications and websites more efficiently. Web frameworks typically follow MVC (Model-View_Controller) architectural pattern to seperate the concerns of an application

Developers can choose a web framework based on their programming language preferences, project requirements, and the ecosystem and communicty support sourounding each framework

### Fatal Mistake

Spend the time to figure out how the system works. Do not try to guess how it works or change it to fit your understanding. 

### Django

The only thing you actually write when you build a django application is the endpoints. Django calls the enpoints views.

### Creating apps in Django
* Create an app using the command python manage.py startapp "name of app"
* After creating the app you can create views in the views.py folder of your app directory
* Create an app by defining a function

### Quick reference for installing and running a django project and application

```
Create a folder for your project to live in.
Initialize poetry in that folder: poetry init
Add Django: poetry add Django
Create a Django project: django-admin startproject <project name> replace <project name> with the name of your project
Change the directory into your project directory (the one with manage.py)
Create an app: python manage.py startapp <appname>
Open up your projects settings.py file and remove all of the apps except the staticfiles and contenttype apps from the INSTALLED_APPS list.
Also, remove the auth and messages context processors from the TEMPLATES array
Add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS list
Remove all of the middleware except the clickjacking, security, and common middleware.
Remove the admin URLs from the project's urls.py file.
Create a urls.py file in your app. Add the following content to it:

from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    # put your paths here
    (looks like 
    urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('passwords/', views.passwords, name='passwords'),
])
]
Include your app's URLs in the project's urls.py file.

Build your app! 

```
* Don't forget in the projects URL files do this
```python
from django.urls import include
urlpatterns = [
    path("", include ("core.urls") ),
]
```
* This makes it so that it will automatically add the urls from the core application
* Then add the following directorys to your application
* static/core
* templates/core
* views.py
* And set up your views.py to look like this
```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpRequest, httpresponse

# Create your views here.
def index(request: HttpRequest):

```
