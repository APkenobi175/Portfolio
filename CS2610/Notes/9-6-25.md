# Advanced Python


### First Class

First class - can be assigned to a variable
in python, functions are first class
 ```python

def printHello():
    print("Hello!")

a = printHello

a()


```

### Higher order function

A function that takes another function as an argument

```python

def find(data, conditionFunction):
    for x in data:
        if conditionFunction(x):
            return True
    return False



myData = [1,2,3,4,5,6,76,8]


def myConditionFunction(num):
    return num > 50

print(find(myData, myConditionFunction()))
print(find(myData, lambda x: x == 34))
```
You can define a lambda function. You can only have is an expression no statements. It takes the value X and returns 34. basically seeing if there is a 34 in the list

### Modules
* To import modules they must be declared in the top scope of the file. Now you can reference functions from other files
* you can also import specific functions from module
```python
from myModule import say_hello 
```
* You can also import from files in another directory (utils/src, etc) folder name, name of module, thing you are importing
* You can make an __init__.py and treat a folder like a module and it will juyst import stuff from that file

### Virtual Enviroments
* Virtual Enviroments ensures you have the correct version of a library.
* pip is a package installer for python
```bash 
pip freeze
```
* This command shows you all python packages installed
* A virtual enviroment is a seperate install of python that can be run from a project 
* To create a virtual enviroment use this command
```bash
pip install virtualenv
python -m virtualenv vevn 
```
* When you run this it creates a .venv folder, inside there is a bin folder.
* Inside there is a script you run that activates the virtual enviroment 
* After activating it you can leave the virtual enviroment by closing the terminal
* if you want to activate it again run the activate script again
* if you run a virtual installation and pip install, it installs it only for that virtual installation of python
*
