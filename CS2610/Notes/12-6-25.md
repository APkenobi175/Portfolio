# Connecting to External APIs in Django and React

## External APIS

* Almost every API requires you to be authenticated
* This is done to protect your data and ensure that only authorized users can access it
* TO interact with APIs we do it with an API token
* Whenever you make request with the API you use that token to prove your identity
* YOu need to keep your token a secret and not share it and never push it to github and not hardcode it into your application

* I could use an API to see phases of the moon for my astrophotography app
* I could use an API to get weather data for my astrophotography app

* We will place our API key in the `.env` file
* And make sure to add that file to our `.gitignore` file so we don't push it to github

```env
TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

* All the request has to go through our server first, and then our server has to proxy it to the external API
* YOu cannot connect through a web browser directly to an external API that requires an API key because you would be exposing your API key to the public
* So we will create a view in Django that will handle the request to the external API

* MAke sure you read the documentation for the external API you are using to see how to make requests to it
* We will use the `requests` library to make requests to external APIs in Django
* If you don't have it installed you can install it with `pip install requests`

* Lets think about some APIs we can use for our astrophotography session app
* One option is the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data
* Another option is the NASA API to get astronomy data
* Another option is for phases of the moon we can use the darksky API
