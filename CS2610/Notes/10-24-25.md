# Node JS
* This is a way you can run Javascript without a web browser. 
* Its something you can install and run javascript in the terminal
### FIle System Module
* You can read/write files with Javascript using a fs module

```js
const fs = require("fs")
fs.writeFileSync("my_file.txt", "I am being written to a file")
```
* This allows you to do cool things without a browswer!!
* We will be using nodeJS for a front end web developement 


### Node Project

* A node project is not so different from a python project
* create a package.json.
* Kind of like poetry but for nodejs
```bash
npm init
```
The file look slike this:

```
{
	 "name": "phippsammon",
	  "version": "1.0.0",
	  "description": "",
	  "license": "ISC",
	  "author": "",
	  "type": "commonjs",
	  "main": "js.js",
	  "scripts": {
	  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
	           }
	           }
	                	      
	                }
}
```
* This is used to describe our dependancies
* To install a depandy we run npm install and the name of the dependancies
```
npm install express --save
```

* express is a dependancy we will use don't forget to do --save
* It will create a folder called node_modules
* NodeJS is very dependancy heavy
* Express has nearly 30 dependancies 
* Express depends on a bunch of librarys.

* Express is safe. 
* To use the dependancy we require it like we did in the previous code block
```
const express = require("express");
const app = express ();
const port = 3000;

app.listen(port, () => {
	console.log(`listening on port ${port}`);
})
```
* That is how you make a cool server
* To add an endpoint to it, 
```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express ();
const port = 3000;


app.get("/", (req, res) => {
		res.send("<H1>Hello World!</H1>");
		});


		app.listen(port, () => {
				console.log(`listening on port ${port}`);
				})
				
		})
})
```
* We are not gonna use express anymore lol
