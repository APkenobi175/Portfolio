# Skew Heaps

### Problems with Leftist heaps
- Extra storage for NPL (null path length)
- Extra complexity to maintain and check NPL
### Solution: Skew Heaps
- Blind adjusting version of leftist heaps
- amortized time for merge, insert, and deleteMin is O(logn)
- Worse case for each is O(n)
- merge always switches children along right path
- Can be done iteratively

We always merge with the right child but after merging we swap the left and right children for every node in the resulting right path of the temporary tree


Code example for merging
```java

private Node<E> merge( Node<E>t1, Node<E> t2) {
Node<E> small;
if (t1==null) return t2;
if (t2==null) return t1;
if (t1.element.compareTo( t2.element ) < 0) {
t1.right = merge(t1.right, t2);
small=t1;}
else {
t2.right = merge(t2.right, t1);
small=t2;}
swapkids(small);
return small;
}

```

Swap all the way back up. Insert on the right and swap kids all the way back up

# Binary Heaps
Binary qeueues support PQ operations in O(log N) ime

Maintain a collection of heap-ordered trees (forest of binomial trees)

Forest of binomial heaps based on depth

- B0 2^0= 1 nodes
- B1 2^1 = 2 nodes
- B2 2^2 = 4 nodes
- B3 2^3 = 8 nodes
- etc

Building a Binomial tree
Add nodes to B0, smallest ones become main root

if you become bigger then merge

find Min - You have to search all trees

Binomial Queue = 'forest' of heap-ordered binomial trees.


### Merging Binary Heaps

- Merge individual binary trees
- Start with Bk for smallest k in either queue
- if only one Bk add Bk to new queue and go to next larger k
- Merge to Bks to get new Bk+1 by making larger root the child of smaller root
- Do step 2 again with k = K+1

Run time for merge - logn


### Inserting 

Create a single node with new item and mere with existing queue

O(logn) time

DeleteMin
1. Find tree Bk with smallest root
2. Remove Bk from the queue
3. Delete the root of Bk (return this value); you now have a new queue made up for the forest b0, b1, ..., bk-1
4. Merge this queue with other trees of the original (step 2)
5. Total time = O(log n)



# Comparing Heaps

#### AVL tree as a PQ
#### Binary Heaps (stored as an array)
#### Binomial Queues
#### Leftist Heaps
#### Skew Heaps#

# Sorting

Stable - Retains orginal order if keys are the same. In asking if a sort is stable, we are asking can it
be reasonably coded to be stable? I sort vards by value, then I sort them by suit.
Are they in order by value within suit?

Stability - If you sort by 2 things the first thing isn't destroyed 

#### Example:
Sorted by last name, then sorted by first name - Stable

## Heap Sort

Input: Unordered Array

1. Build a _Max_ heap
2. for i = 0 to n-1 delete_max()

NOT STABLE - you are not going to get stability without specifically coding for stability, you have to work for it


Adaptive - takes advantage of exisiting order to do less work

Sort by address - uses indirect addressing sot he data doesn't have to be moved

Inversion - a pair of elements that is out of order. Important tin determining
a lower bound.


## Sorting - the big picture
- Simple algorithms (O(n^2)) - Insertion, Selection, Bubble
- Fancier Algorithms (O(nlogn)) - Heap sort, Merge sort, Quick sort
- Specialized algorithms (O(n)) - Bucket sort, Radix sort

### Insertion Sort
- Sorts by inserting records into an already sorted portion of the array
- Two groups of keys sorted and unsorted
- insert n times  - each time have to move abut i/2 elements to insert
- Notice the more inorder it is initially the fewer moves
- Stable
- Adaptive
