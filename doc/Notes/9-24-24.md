# Hashing

Birthday paradox - what are the odds that the same 2 people have the same birthday?

This is like collisions in a hash table

How do we turn a string into a number that has good properties?

### Hash Function 1 - Adding characcters

```java
public static int hash(String key){
    int hashVal = 0;
    for(char c: key.toCharArray()) hashVal += c;
    hashVal = hashVal % TABLESIZE;
    if (hashVal < 0) hashVal += TABLESIZE;
    return hashVal
}
```

Convert each letter into ascii and add them together to get the number 
Doesn't completely get rid of collisions

Negative numbers are stored as 2s complement  

what does that mean bruh

Suppose were working with 8 bit quantaties and supposed we want to find ot -28 would be expressed in twos complement notation. first we write out 28 in binary form

00011100

Then we invert the digits (complimenting)

11100011

then we add 1

11100100

that is how one would write in -28 in 8 bit binary



We can overflow a number so much that it turns negative, its kinda complicated

In java mods can be a negative number

gal and lag same codes


### Hash Function 2 - Slide and add

Better as uses broader range

gal and lag would get different codes

concern is that first elements could get slid off

if the number gets too large to store it throws away most significant bits

```java
public static int hash2(String key){
    int hashVal = 0;
    for (char c: key.toCharArray()) hashVal = hashVal*128 + c;
    hashVal = hashVal % TABLESIZE;
    if (hashVal < 0) hashVal += TABLESIZE;
    return hashVal;
}
```

### Hash Function 3

Since we use bitwise exclusive **or** to put the original hashVal back in we aren't in danger of losing the effect of the first characters

we can get a negative when int overflows as stored in twos complement

```java
public static int hash3(String key){
    int hashVal = 0;
    for (char c: key.toCharArray()){
        hashVal = (hashVal << 5)^c^hashVal;
    }
    hashVal = hashVal % TABLESIZE;
    if (hashVal < 0) hashVal += TABLESIZE;
    return hashVal;
}
```

Reduces collisions and solves problems from other 2 hash functions.

^ means exclusive or. Exclusive ors work at the bit level 

10110110 + 
11001100

01111010


### Built in

Java has built in hashCode defined for basic types. For user-defined types we need to supply the hashCode() function.

### Collisions 

When two values hash to the same array location - thats called a collision
