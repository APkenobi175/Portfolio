# Up-Tree Data Structure

* Each subset is an uptree with its root as its representativ emember
* all members of a given set are nodes in that sets up-tree
* if data isn't easily converted toa  subscript, a hash table maps input data to the node associated with that data
* Up-trees are not binary!
* Find - Olog(n)
