# Graph Algorithms

## Dijkstra's algorithm
- Mark all nodes unvisited
- assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for initial node and infinity for all other nodes
- for current node consider all of its unvisited neighbrors and calculate their tentative distances from the current node
- when we are all done considering all the unvisted neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited
- select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new current node and go back to step 3
- **Greedy algorithm** proceeds in stages doing the best at each stage. best first search
- Complexity: E log E


## Graphs with negative edge costs
Negative cost: Add a large enough constant to every edge weigh so that no edge is negative
Dijkstras algorithm does not work with negative edge costs.

BellmanFord's Algorithm does work with negative edge weights.

What is bellman fords algorithm?

## BellmanFord's Algorithm
- Ignore the idea of a "known vertex" since with negative weights previously known vertices may get a smaller value
- We put each node we need to consider on a queue
- Begin by placing the start vertex on a queue at each stage, we remove a node from the queue
- we eamine the cost to all successors for any successor whos distance has decreased we change the distance and place that node on the queue aggain
- we stop when all nodes have been removed. 
- if we have negative cycles we will be in an infinite loop, so we need to check for that

## Acyclic Graphs
- If a graph is known to be acyclic we will find the shortest path faster if consider nodes in topological order as distance of predecessors is known before visiting a node
- runnig time = O(|V| + |E|)
- This selection rule works because when a vertex is selected, its distance can't be less, since by topological orderring rule it has no incoming edges emanating from unknown nodes

## All pairs shortest path (Floyd Warshall Algorithm)
- Copy original matrix, add new transitive edges
