# Priority Queues (Heaps)
Simple data structures can be used as a pririority queue.

* Unsorted List - O(n)
* Sorted List: O(1)
* BST trees - logn
* Splay Trees - logn
* AVL trees - logn

Heap-Order property (Min Tree):
* Parent's key is less than or equal to children's key
* Minimum is always all top

Store by level allows us to easily find parents/kids without references

Calculations:
- Child: 2i+1, 2i+2
- Parent: i-1/2
We can find children and parent nodes by just using formulas.

We have to force our will on priority queues to get desired shape

## Heap sort

input: unordered array
1. Build a max heap (Largest element is A[0])
2. for i = 0 to n-1 A[n-1] = delete_Max()

Delete max, then sort the tree

Worst case OnLogn
build heap - O(n)
n Delete_max's for O(nlogn)




### Floyds method

Change existing array into a min heap
Smaller on top bigger on bottom

Advantage is hat a node can only be shifted to a leaf - Most nodes are close toa  leaf

Still O(n)


## Merge

Different scholarship PQs which need to merge after certian deadlines

this would not be efficent with AVL tree or heap - we need something new


We have 2 heaps, we want to merge them in log(n) time

idea: use a real binary tree


### Leftist Heap (Mergeable)
Binary heap-ordered trees with left subtrees always longer than right subtrees

Recursively work on right path for merge, insert, deleteMin

right path is always short, has Ologn nodes

Merge,, insert, deletemin all have o(logn) run time

**Null path length** - The shortest path from a node to a node without 2 children

npl(null) = -1

npl(leaf) = 0

npl(single-child node) = 0

Min heap-order property
- The parent's priority value is <= childrens priority value
- minimum element is at the root
Leftist Property:
- Null path length of left subtree is >= npl of right subtree
- tree is at least as heavy o the left as right
- 

Rightmost path in a leftist tree is short

You have two trees - decide who wins ( the one that smaller wins and becomes the root)
.,,,Keeps its left child - compare the right child again and decide who wins
on the way out swap subheaps were necessary - find unhappy nodes
