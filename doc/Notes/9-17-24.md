## AVL Trees Continued

It is easier to delete from a leaf as allwe have to do is check balance. 

With insertion theres only 1 unhappy node and you can fix it

With Deletion all the nodes can be unhappy.

### Benefits of AVL Trees
* Search is O(logn) since AVL trees are always balanced
* Insertion and Deletions are also O(logn)
* The height balancing adds no more than a constant factor to the speed of insertion

### Cons of AVL Trees
* Difficult to program and debug
* Asymptotically faster but rebalancing costs time
* Most Large searches are done in database systems on disk and use other structures (e.g B+ Trees)
* May be OK to have O(n) for a single operation of total run time for many consecutive operations is fast (Splay Trees)


## Splay Trees

### Problems with AVL Trees
* Extra storage for height fields
* Complicated COde


Another Approach is an Splay Tree
* Blind adjusting version of balanced trees
* Amortized time for all operations O(log N)
* Worse Case is O(n)
* Insert/Find always rotates accessed node to the root
* Similar to AVL Trees but you dont have to balance
* Are Binary Search Trees

### Splay Tree Terminology
Let X be a non-root node with >=2 ancestors

P is its parents node

G is its grandparent node

Four cases(Ignoring other parts of tree) - zig-zig and zig-zag

**IMPORTANT DON'T FORGET**

***Looking two levels up***

**IMPORTANT**

You are trying to move X to the root

Zig - Single rotation

Zig-Zag - Double rotation

Zig-Zig - Two single rotations of the same direction.

### Insert
* Insert the Node as normal BST operation
* Set the Node to the root
* Look up two levels and rotate as needed
* O(logn)

### Find
* Find as normal and splay to the root
* O(logn) average


### Delete
* Splay x to root and remove it
* Splay the max in the left subtree to the root
* attach the right subtree as a right subtree of other root
* Many different methods to delete but this is how we'll do it in this class


## B+ Trees!
