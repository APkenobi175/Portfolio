# Finding Strongly Connected Components

- First do a depth first search numbering nodes in post order

## Algorithms

1. Greedy Algorithms
   - Choose the locally best option during each phase
   - Dijkstra (shortest path), Prim (minimal spanning tree), Kruskal (minimal spanning tree)
   - Making change in fewest number of coin
   - choose largest coin at each round
   - does this always work?
   - no
