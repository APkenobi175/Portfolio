### Subgraph
Suppose parts of the graph represent one way steets in a town.  I would take out those most imported nodes and the edges between them, and that is the subgraph
A graph that consists of a subset of vertices and all the edges between those vertices
### Simple graph

A simple graph does not contain:
* Multiple edges between the same two nodes
* Self-edges (edges of the form (a,a) also called a loop)
### Multigraph
A graph that allows multiple edges between the same pair of nodes

### Paths
* A *path* is a sequence of edges
* A *Simple path* is a path with no repeated vertices or edges
* the *Length of a Path* is the sum of the path

# Graph Traversal Techniques
There are two standar graph traversal techniques
1. Breadth First Search (BFS)
2. Depth First Search (DFS)

### Depth First Search
Uses recursion
Explores a branch in depth before moving on to the next branch. DFS uses a stack to store nodes.
Start in order, can we visit new nodes? Visit them! backtrack until you can visit new nodes


### Breadth first search
Explores every node on a level before moving on to the next level. BFS uses a queue to store nodes. 
Rules:

### Topological Ordering 
List all the edges in order
Has to be a directed graph
