# BST

Preorder - the root is the first number

Inorder - gives us the order of the Tree!

## Allan Technique

1. Decide that the problem needs recrsive solution
2. Decide specifically what the procedure will do, what are its inputs and outputs?
3. Restate the problem recursively look for instances of the problem you defined
4. Write the procedure using instances of itself. Only worry about a single call of the routine.
5. Don't be tempted to follow the recursion, have faith that the recursions will work

End with the base case!

Once the routine is written go ahead and follow the recursion

### Practice

Step 1 - THe problem needs to be solved recursively

Step 2 - Whats coming in whats going out?

Input: FindBig(int [] s, int low, int high) (Divide array into half)
Output: int

Step 3 - Restate the problem recursively
