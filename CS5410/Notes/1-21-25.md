# CS5410 Class 3 - 1/21/25 Notes

## Announcments

* Goal for today is talk about how to get scenes to communicate with each other
* Implementing several algorithms (Ways function collapse)
* Talking about ways to generate game enviroments
* Barrier is how to make more things for my game, using algorithms.
* Procedural generation is a big topic in games
* Assignment 1 due date moved to wednesday 1/28/26
* You are gonna have to dive back to your data strucutures and algorithms class for this assignment

### Tree communication

* Your nodes should never know what its parent is
* Keep them disconnected so they can be reused
* The way nodes talk to each other is through something called signals
  * Signals are a way for nodes to broadcast messages to other nodes
    * You can connect signals to functions in other nodes
    * Example: A button node has a "pressed" signal that is emitted when the button is pressed
    * This allows you to communicate between nodes without them knowing about each other
    * Parent Node -> method call -> Child node -> emit signal -> Parent Node


### Health System Example

* We have dealing damage, taking damage, and health we need to implement
* We will follow the idea of where we call methods going down, emit signals going up

* Create three seperate scenes for each of these systems
  * Hitbox, Hurtbox, and Health

  * Add to the tank the health component.
