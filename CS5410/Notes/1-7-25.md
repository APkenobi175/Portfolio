# CS5410 Class 1 - 1/7/25 Notes

## Introduction to the Course

* This course will be hard
* There will be 3 projects
* Start early because they are difficult
* Office hours are important
* Join the team on microsoft teams
* Open note, open book, open ai exam

### Godot Engine Architecture

* Inheritance may not be the best way to structure game code.
* Behavior composition is often better
* Godot strongly encourages behavior composition over inheritance.
* It prefers a node over a tree structure.
### Setup

* Make vscode your default editor for godot
* Create folders assets, scripts, and scenes
* Create a main scene and set it as the main scene in project settings
* Create a player scene and instance it in the main scene
* Add a camera to the player scene and set it as current
* The lower down in the scene tree, the more detailed the node is, the higher the more abstract

### Scripting in Godot

* Right click on your character scene and attach a new script
* Select C# as the language
* IT should automatically open in vscode
* When Godot traverces the tree, when it reaches an object with a script, it will execute the script
* This uses post-order traversal

* Script Setup for a node:

```csharp
using Godot;
using System;

public partial class Player : Node2D
{

	// Use these methods they way they are intended to be used
	
	public override void _Ready()
	{
		// this is called when the node is added to the scene
		// Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
		// also happens every time the node is added to the scene.

	}

	public override void _Process(double delta)
	{
		// this is called every frame
		// This is the primary game loop function.
		// Every time we iterate through the loop we need to update things
		// this method will be called hundreds of times per second
		// you want it to be called as much as possible
		// You should NOT do expensive operations here
		// This process is basically the FPS counter of your game
	}

	public override void _PhysicsProcess(double delta)
	{
		// this is called every physics frame
		// This is similar to _process, but its capped at a fixed rate
		// This is where you handle physics-related updates or simulations
		// Godot defaults this to 60 frames per second
		// Using Godots built in physics engine in here
	}

	public override void _Draw()
	{
		// this is called when the node is drawn to the screen
		// You can use this to do custom drawing on the node
		// For example drawing a sprite. You give it the image and it will draw the node
		base._Draw();
		// The rendering is not dependant on the physics
		// Your game should be entirely playable through its inputs
		// without any rendering at all
		// This is useful for debugging or visual effects
		// You should never change the behavior of your game based on rendering


	}

}
```

### Godot APIs

* A lot of the GD APIs can be accessed via GD. For example GD.Randomize()

* Get used to vector classes.

### Drawing

```csharp
DrawCircle(new Vector2(0, 0), 10, Colors.Red);

```

* THis is how you draw a circle

### Moving the circle

```csharp
Position += new Vector2(200 * (float)delta, 0);
```

* This is how you move the circle in the _process method

* Position is in respect to local space, NOT the entire world

* If we want to draw things at their GLOBAL position, for example if we want 0,0 to mean world space 0,0 like the center of the world, we have to take our local position and subtract `GlobalPosition` from it

```csharp
DrawCircle(new Vector2(Position.X, Position.Y) - GlobalPosition, 10, Colors.Red);
```

* YOu don't have to do this very often, but it is useful to know about

* Yuo can set positions in the editor, you don't have to do it in the code.

* Attatch the camera to the player for the flappy bird game
