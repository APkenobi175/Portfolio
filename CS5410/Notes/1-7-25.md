# CS5410 — Class 1 Notes (Jan 7, 2026)

## Course Overview
- This course will be hard.
- There will be **3 projects**.
- Start early — the projects are genuinely time-consuming.
- Office hours matter.
- Join the class team on Microsoft Teams.
- Exams are **open note, open book, and OpenAI** (as stated in class).

## Godot Engine Architecture (Big Idea)
- Traditional OOP inheritance often becomes messy in games.
- **Composition > inheritance** is usually better for game code.
- Godot strongly encourages composition by building behavior out of a **tree of nodes**.
- Lower in the scene tree = more specific/detail.
- Higher in the scene tree = more abstract/structural.

---

## Project Setup Checklist
- Set VS Code as the default script editor for Godot.
- Create folders:
  - `assets/`
  - `scenes/`
  - `scripts/`
- Create a `Main` scene and set it as the main scene in **Project Settings**.
- Create a `Player` scene and **instance** it inside the Main scene.
- (For Flappy) You *can* attach a `Camera2D` to the player and set it current, but:
  - If you use “world moves left, bird stays mostly fixed,” you may not need the camera to follow the player.

---

## Scripting in Godot (C#)
- Right click a node (like your Player root node) → **Attach Script**
- Choose **C#**
- It should open in VS Code automatically.

### When does a script run?
- Godot calls lifecycle methods automatically when the node is in the scene tree.
- Important callbacks:
  - `_Ready()` runs when the node enters the scene tree (good for initialization).
  - `_Process(delta)` runs every rendered frame (variable rate).
  - `_PhysicsProcess(delta)` runs at a fixed timestep (default ~60 Hz).
  - `_Draw()` runs when the node is drawn (useful for debug/custom drawing).

> Note: “post-order traversal” is not a super useful mental model for day-to-day Godot scripting.  
> What matters is: nodes enter the scene tree, then `_Ready()` triggers, and the game loop calls `_Process`/`_PhysicsProcess` every frame.

## Standard Player Script Template (C#)

```csharp
using Godot;

public partial class Player : Node2D
{
    public override void _Ready()
    {
        // Called once when the node enters the scene tree.
        // Good place to cache child nodes and initialize variables.
    }

    public override void _Process(double delta)
    {
        // Called every rendered frame (frame rate can vary).
        // Good for UI updates and non-physics visual effects.
        // Avoid expensive work here.
    }

    public override void _PhysicsProcess(double delta)
    {
        // Called at a fixed timestep (default ~60 FPS).
        // Best place for movement, gravity, and collision logic.
        // Still use delta — it protects you from frame drops.
    }

    public override void _Draw()
    {
        // Called when the node is drawn.
        // Useful for debug drawing (shapes, lines), not usually for sprites.
        base._Draw();
    }
}
