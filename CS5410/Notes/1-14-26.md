# CS5410 Class 2 - 1/14/26 Notes

## Announcements



## Game States / Input / Collision / Architecture

- You want your state to be controlled only as far up the tree as necessary
- Your top nodes will get really heavy. Don't cram everything in main

- Using [Tool] at the beginning of a script will make it render in the scene's editor
  - Be careful with this, it can slow down the editor AND it can do some funky things

- Using draw method will make it easier to debug things
  - You can draw lines, shapes, text, etc



### Input Handling

- Two ways to handle

  - Polling
    - Every frame you check the input state
    - Example: if key is pressed, move player forward
  - Event Driven
    - You register for events, and when they happen you get notified
    - Example: on key press event, move player forward

- Polling is easier to implement, but can be less efficient
- Event driven is more efficient, but can be more complex to implement

- Continous input should be handled in polling
- Discrete input should be handled in event driven (flappy bird)


### Collisions

- Area Collision
  - Did thing A overlap thing B?
  - Simple to implement
  - To do this we use an Area2D node
  - Area2D will need a CollisionShape2D child node in order for it to work (one or more)

  - The only child you should have on an Area2D is CollisionShape2D nodes

  - YOu don't have to convert the player to an Area2D to detect collisions
  - You can add an area2d as a child to player

  
- Physics

- A rigid body is a physics object that is affected by forces, gravity, etc
- A character body is a special type of rigid body that is designed for characters
  - It has built in functions for moving, jumping, etc
- A static body is a physics object that is not affected by forces, gravity, etc

- IF you have a static body and a rigid body and the static body hits the rigid body, the rigid body will react, but the rigid body will not move.

- If you have a box thats a rigid body, and you move a character body into it, the box will move out of the way, with the character body

- Lets say I have a box in the road and I hit it with a car. The car is going to move the box. The car will be a rigid body and the box will be a rigid body. The car will apply a force to the box and the box will move.

- We want our platform to be a static body because we don't want it to move when the player lands on it.
