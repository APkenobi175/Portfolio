# Flappy Bird Clone – Godot Foundations (C#)

## Core Design Decision
This project follows the **classic Flappy Bird model**:
- The **player stays mostly fixed on the X axis**
- The **world (pipes, floor, background) moves left**
- The camera stays fixed (no need to follow the player)

This simplifies:
- Spawning and despawning pipes
- Game state resets
- UI and score handling

---

## Player Scene Structure

### Player (Node2D)
**Purpose:** Logic & control  
- Holds the C# script
- Stores position, rotation, velocity
- Handles input (flap), gravity, death state
- When this node moves or rotates, all children follow

This is the “brain” of the player.

---

### Sprite2D
**Purpose:** Visual representation  
- Displays the bird texture or animation
- Contains no gameplay logic
- Automatically follows Player position & rotation

Sprites should be handled by nodes — not `_Draw()`.

---

### Area2D
**Purpose:** Collision detection  
- Detects overlaps with pipes, floor, ceiling
- Emits signals like `area_entered`
- Does NOT apply physics forces

This is ideal for Flappy Bird because:
- We only need to know *if* something touched us
- We do not need friction, mass, or bouncing

---

### CollisionShape2D
**Purpose:** Defines the hitbox shape  
- Circle or rectangle
- Required for Area2D to function
- Purely geometric — no logic

---

## Why `_Draw()` Is Not Used for Gameplay
`_Draw()` is for:
- Debug visuals
- Custom shapes
- Temporary diagnostics

It should NOT be used for:
- Sprites
- Gameplay visuals
- Player representation

Godot is node-driven, not immediate-mode rendering.

## Game Loop Methods

### `_Process(double delta)`
- Runs every rendered frame
- Frame rate is **variable**
- Depends on computer performance
- Best for:
  - UI updates
  - Non-critical visual effects

Not suitable for physics or movement.

---

### `_PhysicsProcess(double delta)`
- Runs at a **fixed timestep** (default ~60 FPS)
- Deterministic and consistent
- Ideal for:
  - Gravity
  - Velocity
  - Position updates
  - Collision logic

All player motion belongs here.

---

## What `delta` Means
`delta` = **time elapsed since the last frame**, in seconds.

Examples:
- At 60 FPS → `delta ≈ 0.016`
- At 30 FPS → `delta ≈ 0.033`

Why it matters:
- Makes movement frame-rate independent
- Ensures the bird falls the same speed on all machines

Correct usage:
```csharp
velocity.Y += gravity * delta;
Position += velocity * delta;
```

## What `Vector2` Means

`Vector2` = A 2D vector with `X` and `Y` components.
- Represents positions, directions, velocities
- Example: `Vector2(100, 200)` means:
  - `X = 100` (horizontal position)
  - `Y = 200` (vertical position)
- Used for movement calculations:
```csharp
Vector2 velocity = new Vector2(0, 150); // Moving down at 150 units/sec
Position += velocity * delta; // Update position based on velocity and time
```
- Essential for 2D game development in Godot
