# SUN / Pizza Cutting

### SUN
* **Sufficent Implies Necessary**
	* P => Q
	* P = Sufficient Condition for Q
	* Q = Necessary Condition for P
	* If a condition is labeled if then its stating a condition thats sufficient for something and necessary for something. So Q MUST be P, P must not be Q
	* Max Score => Queen (A queen doesn't need to have max score, but a max score does make a queen), but queen !=> max score
	* 

### Pizza Cutting
* You have your circular pizza thats all cut up, how do you convert it to a graph
* How are you going to say something generic enough
* Your vertexes are the insercetions of cuts
* Now its a graph, and a planar one. you have faces (the pieces of pizza)
* You can count the number of vertices
* N = Num of cuts made (4)
* num of verticies - edges + faces = 2, solve for F
* throw the outer region out you don't have an infinite pizza. Solve for F-1
* Every pair of cuts determines a unique 
* Every cut inserects the crust twice
* The number of vertigies |V(G)| (n 2) + 2n
* Add up vertex degrees to get number of Edges
* G = V2 U Vc = SUM(deg(v)) = SUM(degree(v)) + SUM(Degree(c)

* If you can't determine the degree on the crust and interior, then do something else

#### Verteces
* Crust vertex's = 3 degrees
* Interior Vertex = 4 degrees
* Now you can count N, E, and deduce F. You are looking for F-1 guys REMBER BRO HAM

* **Graph theory is so general it can be applied to about anything**

### Question 5.4
* "G is hamiltonian" means G has a hamiltonian cycle (not have a hamiltonian path)


### THEOREMS (One you have to prove on the mid term)
1. Dirac's Theorem
	* Assume G is a graph on N>=3 Vertices
	* If minimum vertex deg(v) >= n/2, 
		* Then, G is hamiltonian. 
	
2. Ore's Theorem
	* Assume G is a graph on N>=3 vertices
	* IF for any NON ADJACENT vertices X, and Y,
		* The Degree of X + the Degree of Y > = N
		* Then, G is a hamiltonian path


* If a graph is hamiltonian it doesn't say anything about its vertex degree, however if the vertex degree is high enough then it is hamiltonian DAWG

* If G is hamiltonian than the minimum vertex degree of G >=2 NECESASARY 


* If Dirac's Theorem is true then Ore's is also definately true regardless if the verteces are adjacent or not
* The sum of two vertex degrees is Sigma 2
* YOu can use Ore's Theorem to prove DIirac's (Might be useful on the mid term)



### Proof INFO
* The kitten grinder principle (pidgeon hole principle)
* Take N-1 Grinders and N kittens
* Use this in your homework: "By the Kitten Grinder Principle(Pidgeon Hole)"

* Smile Proof - Not an actualy proof tactic 
### Dirac's Theorem Proof via Smile Proof
1. Assume G has minumum vertex degree >= n/2 but is NOT hamiltonian AND has maximum numbers of edges
2. n/2 verticies have to be neighbors to v1, v2, v3, ,etc
3. There has to be a structure where Vn has an edge to Vi and V1 hits vi+1. theres your hamiltonian cycle (cat grinder principle)
