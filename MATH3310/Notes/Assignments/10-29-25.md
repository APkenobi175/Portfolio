# Cool Things
A={a1, a2, ... an (SHINY DiSTINGUISHED ELEMENT)}
* (N Choose K) = Number of subsets of size K one can get from A
* ((N choo-choose K)) = Number of multisets of size k one can from A
* n^k = Number of ways to arrange (say in a line) k objects form A
* {n k} = Number of ways to partition A into K blocks


### Theorum
* m^n = n(n-1)(n-2) ... (n-k+1)

* n/1, n-1/2, n-3/3 ... (n-(K+1)) / k
* n! = n^n
( n choose k) = n^k/k! = ((n!)/(k!(n-k))
Proof: k/n = n choose k k!
----------------------------------------------------------------

* A partitions of $A$
	* is a set of TT={B1, B2, ..., Bk}
* Such that:
	1. Union from i=1 to k bi = A
	2. bi != 0
	3. bi and bj = 0


### Example
* A={A1, A2, A3, A4}
* {A Squeeze 2}
* (a1, a2, a3 )(a4) - Partition 1
* (a1)(a2, a3, a4) - Partition 2
* (a2)(a1, a3, a4) - Partition 3
* (a3)(a1, a2, a4) - Partition 4
* (A1, a2)(a3, a4) - Partition 5
* (a1, a4)(a2, a3) - Partition 6

- Temporarily label things for the count, and then undo the count
- Conditioning how big each block is
- Then condition on blocks of size 1


### Claim: A bajillion = 3



* Use { N squeeze n-1} (extreme cases)
* I got n objects to put into n-1 grinders (pidgeon hole principle) One of the box needs 2 items
* Select the 2 that go together the rest are determined. Box them up and move on
* Santa clause is a mathematition but also not one because he doesn't exist.


### {n squeeze k} = 
* an in a block by itself + an not in it's own block. 
* {n-1 squeeze k-1} + k{n-1 squeeze k} 


### Computer Science

* How would you compute (n choose k) if you were a computer
	1. Compute a huge ass factorial and divide by a huge ass factorial and then another one
	2. Dumbest calculation you can make
	3. Those numbers can be extremely large very easily
* Best Way
	1. (n choose k) = (n -1 choose k - 1) + (n-1 choose k)
