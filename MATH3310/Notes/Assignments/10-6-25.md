# WOP
* Any non empty subset of in has a smallest element
* You can't order complex numbers, you don't know what smallest is


### Prove hamiltonian path via maximality argument
* Assume you have a maximum thing and then contradict it
* Start: Take a tournement on n
* Prove that it has a himiltonian path
* Suppose it doesn't and its the biggest tournament you can have that doesn't have one


### OR
* Take a tournament that doesn't have a hamiltonian path, now consider the longest path, that end vertex what is it and can you extend it. 

### Maximality/Minimaility Proof Format
1. Assume you have the largest/smallest thing you are looking for
2. Derive a contradiction



### Example
* Supposed G is a graph
* lower case delta(g) = smallest vertex degree
* uper case delta(G) = largest vertex degree

* if lowercase delta (g) = k, then G has a path of at least length K
* And G has a cycle of length at least k+1


* **PROOF**
* Assume lowercase Delta (g) = k > 0
* Consider a path of maximum length
* (Maximal is not equal to maximum )
* (Ones a noun, maximal, cannot make it any bigger)
* (Maximum is the largest it can possibly be. you can have both or one and not the other)
* P: v1-v2-v3-v4-v5-...-vq 
* every one of the vertices has minimum degree of K or better
* So q has to be K or bigger
* if q has k edges it has to wrap back around k amount of times. It can't go forward
* Neighbors of vq must be on the path, so there must be K of them
* Therefore, P has length at least K. 
* Prove the cycle length too
* You may as well assume you have the biggest one


### HW 4.2
* Use Strong
* There is always a vertex of degree at least the average
* w/ d^t(v) >= (n-1)/2
* u = |v(t)|

* Look at the canonical tournament picture and remember what log base 2 means


# Theorum you need for HW 5 and Mid Term (Another example of maximality/minimality) 5.4

1. G is a hamiltonian graph
	* G has a spanning cycle 
	* Spanning means it contains all vertices (none repeated)
	* does not contain all edges
2. You are gonna have to find the damn thing (quote from professor)
3. NP vs P
	* P != NP
	* P = NP
4. Necessary VS Sufficient
	* Sufficient - P implies Q
	* IT is necessary that a function be continuous for it to be differentiable 
	* if a number is prime and greater than 2 than it is odd
	* Mnemonic
		* SUN
		* Suffiencent implies necessary
		* S => Q
5. **Theorum**
	* G is a graph on at least 3 vertices
	* If the minumum vertex of G is greater than or equal to n/2 then G is hamiltonian (You will prove this on Mid Term)
	* Dirac's Theoreum
	* Oystein???
