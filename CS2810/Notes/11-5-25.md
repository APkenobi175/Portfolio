### Question 1: What does the ALU in the datapath do?

* Does most the math and arithmetic, calculates addresses
* Determines if the PC is branching to a new address or if its just incrementing by 4
* Takes inputs in from data 1 and data 2 outputs either an address
    or value
* Calculates if branch
* Calculates address of memory
* Calculates results for the register

### Question 2: How does the datapath handle the same instruction bits being used for both the destination register and encoding the immediate value

* if its an i-format instruction then rt is being written. the controller indicates that with regDst. rt goes to either write register or read register 2 based on op code.

* You are writing rules that map one input to another. Instructions turn certian flags on to help data flowing correctly

* You don't have control over the hardware, the hardware is set.

* The unused bits still go to their destination they just don't do anything

### Question 3: Which branches/jumps does the datapath support

* beq (ALU zero flag)
