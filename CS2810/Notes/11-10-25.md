## Group Discussion Questions Part 2

---

### Question 1: What do you need and where does it come from to add unconditional jumps

* What you need:
  * Address
  * Control signal
  * Mux

* Where does it come from
  * Address comes from the instruction
  * Control signal comes from the controller

### Question 2: Change the datapath to support unconditional jumps

1. Wire added from the instruction bits [25-0] and it goes through a left shifter
2. After the data is shifted it goes to another mux to select between BEQ and J
3. That second mux is controlled by a new Jump control
4. Logic for the contoller, update the controller to turn off everything else so it works.

### Question 3: Explain the logic that controls the ALU result MUX for the next PC. Your description should icnclude how the ALU is used, what the mux logic does that controls the mux, and what the Control logic does, You should describe an appreach that works for both BNE and BEQ

* ALU
  * The ALU finds the difference between the 2 values
  * if they are the same, the zero flag will be 1
  * if they are different, the zero flag will be 0
* MUX
  * (!Zero & BNE) + (Zero & BEQ)
  
* Control Logic Added
  * 2 ouputs now, BNE and BEQ. Decoded from the instructions
