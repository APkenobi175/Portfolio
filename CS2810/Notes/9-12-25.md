# Binary Representation and Latches
## Wrap up binary representations

### WHy do we need ASCII
* Display information on computers to users
* 128 values containing every character you'd ever need
* can fit into a 7 bit binary number
* what about support for emojis and symbols?


### Unicode

* Uses 16 bits to store 65,356 symbols
* This is the standard in most modern computers


### Latches
* OR Latcch
  * Holds a value, but no way to reset it to 0. Can store memory
* SR Latch
  * A more advanced version of Or latch
  * Lets use move between two states
  * SR Latch = (S)et and (R)eset
    * Outputs, Q and !Q
    * Result is that S=Q and R = !w
    * S = 1 sets the latch (Q = 1)
    * R = 1 resets the latch (Q = 0)
    * S = 0 and R = 1 resets the latch 
    * S = 0 and R = 0 holds the states
    * S = 1 and R = 1 is invalid
    * S = 1 and R = 0 sets the states
* Gated SR Latch
  * Adds a new button (enable) to effect the value of 1
  * Turning enable on lets us set Q
* D Latch (Input = D)
  * Extends the gated SR latch with **one** Set input (still has another input "Enable") using two AND Gates
  * This eliminates the invalid S = 1 and R = 1 state
  * When Q is high: signal is on (bit =1)
  * EN(enable) Controls when the signal is valid. D can be changing
* Edge Detection
  * Computers update Q/Memory at a specific point in the signal when you go from low to high or high to low
  * This allows us to take a snap shot of the memory
  * so memory only changes at the edges of the enable signal (E = 0 to 1)
  * Goal: Design a rising edge detector.
  * Rising Edge Detector:
    * input passed through 3 not gates. 
    * Not equilivlant to 1 not gate, it slows it down and creates a pulse when triggered
    * Combing the rising edge detector with a D latch which gives you a D flip flop
  * D Flip Fop
    * Adding a raising edge detector in front of a d latch slows down the signal
    * Standard way computers store a single bit
    * we can use a clock devgice with auto-simulate
    * you can connect these together to create multi bit memory circuits 
  * 4 Bit D Flip Fop Circuit 
    * Combines 4 1 bit inputs as data
    * stores there values in memory every clock cycle
    * Uses a clock and you must set the clock speed
  * Flip Flop (Rising Edge)
    * Rising Edge Rules:
      * Set Q to 1 if D is up when clock goes up
      * Set Q to 0 if D is down and clock goes up
  * The CLock is essential in sequential circuits because it ensures that all flip fops update in lockstep making the whole system predictable and in sync. Without  a clock different parts could latch values at slighty different imes and cause a lot of bad things to happen. Its about synchronization not speed or power
