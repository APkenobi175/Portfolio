# Test Review #2

### IEEE754 Review
* On the test you may be asked to work with a modified version of IEEE754. 
* For example, it may ask you have a system with 1 sign bit, 3 biased exponent bits, so you would subtract 3 rather than 127 to get the exponenet. and 4 mantissa bits.
* Know how to do this, I know there is a quiz question on this so try and find it and study it
* On the fraction part (Mantissa) instead of multiplying by 2^0, and 2^1 you go x2^-4, x2^-3, x2^-2, up to x2^-1. or nx0.5, nx0.025, etc
* Remember anything following a 1111111111 in the exponent is not a real number. can't do it. Largest exponenet is 11111110, unless its 1111111 followed by 00000000 then its infinity.
* All zeroes, 0000000000000000000000000 = 0
