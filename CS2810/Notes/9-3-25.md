# Binary Numbers

### How it works

Binary code is base 2, which is different than what we are used to, base 10

counts like this 0, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, etc. 

### Convert Binary to Decimal

To calculate numbers from binary to regular. Take the digit in the first sequence and times by 1, then add it to the next times 2, then 4, then 8, etc. it doubles every time

ex: 1110 = 14 (1x8) + (1x4) (1x2) + (0x1) = 14

### Convert decimal to binary

To convert decimal to binary we look at the binary code (0(16), 0(8), 0(4), 0(2), 0(1))

Then, we ask how many times does n go into the value bit #. So if we had 2 we would ask how many times does

2 go into 16,8,4,2,1 etc. 

So 2 goes into 2 once. so 2 = 00010

**Example**:
* decimal 243. 243 goes into 128 once, 1
* 243-128 = 115
* 115 goes into 64 once, 11
* 115-64 = 51
* 51 goes into 32 once, 111
* 51-32 = 19
* etc
* 243 = 11110011
* if you are at the last value and have a non zero number, you did something wrong.


**Excercises**

1. 64 = 1000000
2. 63 = 0111111
3. 78 = 1001110

good job
