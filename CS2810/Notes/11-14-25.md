# LAST UNIT 11-14-25

## News

* One more Unit, on IO
* Assignment 9 Is up - Build CPU
* One more assignment, Assignment 10 - Connect IO

### Some hints for Assignment 9 and 10

* RAM module in subfolder above/input/output
* ROM = Program Memory
* Add a reset button to PC (restart program counter)
* Control has signals to send all over CPU
  * The best way to connect components across the board is with tunnels. If i have tunnels to input/output with same name jump condition

## Computer Arcitecture

### Computer IO

* Programmers don't interact with computers via editing RAM manually
* How can we integrate IO devices with our CPU

### Memory Mapping

* For IO we do something called Memory Mapping
* We can rethink of how our RAM works by splitting it into two parts
* ONn where the data sits, One where the Program sits. Data and Program memory
* IO devices sit in the Data memory*
* Our data memory, part of it is designated for our actual memory
* Then we have the ability for our memory maps in the data memory in the remaining space
* For example a screen memory map, and a keyboard memory map

#### Screen

* For the assignment we will use a 64x128 screen
* There is a 16 bit register for EACH pixel
* There is a 1 bit mapping between pixels and registers
* For 64x128 there will be 8192 16 bit registers
* Computers write the pixels one row at a time from top to bottom

#### RGB565 Format

* First 5 bits for the amount of red
* Second 6 bits for the amount of green
* Last 5 bits for the amount of blue
* These values will be sitting in the register somewhere

### Keyboards

* Every key has an ascii code
* Every time you press a key that ascii code gets passed in

### Memory Implementation

* Memory will take up 16k of the registers. RAM16K
* Screen will take up 8K of the registers
* Keyboard will be for the remaining
* Single address space, 0 to 24575
* Maps the address input onto the address input of the relevant chip
* The memory will only have a 14 bit address, why? because the other 2 are spent elseware
* Turn the screen on for example
* 2^16 = 65,536 registers. We don't need that
* 2^14 = 16384 registers, so 14 bits is exactly what we need
* For the screen we only need 13 bit address because
* 2^13 = 8192 which is the exactly amount of pixels on our screen

### Computer

* For assignment 10 the CPU will be provided for you you just need to plug things in
* Plugging things in requries a certian way to do it
* Its going to have a lot of hooks for loading your program into ROM
* Special hooks for the keyboard and screen too
* Reset button will reset your program counter to 0
* Build a reset button into assignment 9

### Implementation Tips

* Two bits in the address input can be used to determine the target-memory part (RAM16K, screen keyboard)
* The remaining bits of the address input are the address with the target maximum
* Install Logisim Evolution Version 5.0.3 Link in the assignment description
