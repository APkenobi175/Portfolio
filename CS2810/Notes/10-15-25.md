# MIPS Continued

### Loops in MIPS
* Review: Do while loops
	* Useful when you want to execute the code at least once
	* The condition variable needs to get updated inside the loop or else you will never be able to exit
* Loop instructions in MIPS
```mips
.data
	currentMsg: .asciiz "Current Value: "
	newline: .asciiz "\n"

.text
.globl main

main:
	li $t1, 0 # start counter at 0
	li $t2, 2 # end loop at 2
loop:
	# add 1 to the counter
	addi $t1, $t1, 1
	ble $t1, $t2, showCurrent #(Branch if the counter is less than 2 (loop 2 times))

j exit

showCurrent:
	li $v0, 4 # display string current message
	la $a0, currentMsg
	syscall

	li $v0, 1 # display integer
	move $a0, $t1
	syscall

	li $v0, 4 # display string new line
	la $a0, newline
	syscall

	j loop # start the loop again!!!!!!!


exit:
```
* It is similar to the loop I just made in ladder logic at work
