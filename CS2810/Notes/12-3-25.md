### Datapath Jump Instructions

* What does the ALU in the datapath do?
  * Calculates if branch
  * Calculates address of memory
  * Calculates results for the register
*
* How does the datapath handle the same instruction bits being used for both the destination register and encoding the immediate value

  * Control logic decides based on the opcode what to use
    * I format - Ignore the 3rd register use the immediate
    * R format, ignore the immediate use the 3rd register

### Unit 12 - Memory Mapping

* Memory mapping is mapping our memory to certian parts of the computer
* Some will be designated for the Program, and some will be designated for the screen and the keyboard
* THis is within the data memory
* We have seperate memory for storage memory/ROM instruction memory

* The memory designated for the screen must have 1 register for every single pixel
