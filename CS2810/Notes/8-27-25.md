# How do computer represent information
* Through bits, 1s and 0s
* 1 = on, high, true
* 0 = off, low, false
# How to store information
* 1 variable has two possible states with 1 bit (1^2)
* if you have 2 variable you have 4 possible states (2^2)
* with 3 binary variables you have 8 possible states (3^2)
* We can manipulate these bits using addition, subtraction, etc.
# Boolean Operators
### Three Fundamental Operators
* NOT
* AND
* OR

### NOT Operators
* Takes one value. It can flip values for example in truth tables
* Y=!X (not)
* ! Shorthand for not
### AND Operators
* Takes two values
* returns 1 if both inputs are 1
* returns 0 if not both are 1
* · Shorthand for AND
### OR Operators
* If either of the values are 1 then 1 
* if both are 0 then 0
* + Shorthand for OR

## Boolean Algebra
* Similar to regular algebra but you can construct an equation with boolean operators
* Example:
	* A = I need to go to school
	* B = Weather is nice
	* C = Bike is working
* I will walk to school = A · ( B + !C)

* Example 2:
* (A or B) AND (B or NOT A)
* is the same as B?

* Example 3:
* Not ( B or Not A)
* !b * A
**TOCOLOGY = ALWAYS FALSE**

### Laws of Boolean Algebra
* **Identity Law** - A variable remains unchanged when ORed with a 0 and ANDed with 1
	* A * 1 = A (**Identity Law**) | A + 0 = A
* **Zeros and One's Law** 0 * A = 0
* **Inverse Law** - A variable ANDed with its negative results in 0. and ORed with its negative results in 1
	* A *  !A = 0
* **Communitive Law**
* Associative Law - Grouping of operands does not affect the result for AND and OR
* **Distributes Law*** - Distributes an operation over another operation, similar to regular algebra
* **De Morgan's Law** - Describes how to distrubute NOT across AND and OR operation
	* The trickiest law
		* A it is raining
		* B it is cold
		* !(A+B) When you distribute the ! you have to flip the sign, its Not A AND its not B
		* Neither can be true
		* Its not or its and
	* IT FLIPS THE AND AND OR OPERATORS, You can convert an AND expression into an OR expression
### Practice
1. !(A . B) . (A+!B)
	1. (!A + !B) . (A + !B) = !B (its not A because of the first expression so its not A and A or not B)
	2. First - Distribute - (!A + !B) . (A+!B) move the !B outside (GCF) 
	3. !B + (!A . A) - Now we can see that !A . A is false, so its 0. That's the inverse Law. 
	4. !B + 0 = !B that's the Identity Law I think
	5. 3 Dots = Conclusion
2. ( A + B) + (!B + !A) = 1 everything is true.
	1. Associate Law - Combine (A + B + !B + A!)
	2. Communitive Law - Same variables together (A + !A + !B + B)
