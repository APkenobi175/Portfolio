## Announcements

* Exam grades tonight
* Everyone did decent

### Processor Speed and Pipelining

#### Critical Path Delay (CPD)

* S-R Flip Flop Gate
* CPD is the longest of all paths
* Ensures all signals can fit within the clock cycle
* THe time in between is called the critical path delay
* The clock should be delayed enough so the signal can go through it all
* The slowest path determines the clock speed, thats our critical path

#### How to count total delay

* We start at 0 on our inputs
* We get to our first gate, and thats 10ns
* We add our second gate to the total, that gives us 20ns
* Total delay is 20ns
* So, the CPD is 20ns
* So, our clock speed has to be more than 20ns

#### Clock Speed

* 1/CPD and convert it into hertz
* 1/20ns = 50MHz
* So, your clock speed needs to be higher than 50MHz

#### Practice

* When does the signal reach S, Cout, and what is the CPD
  1. S = 40ns
  2. Cout = 45ns
  3. CPD = 1/45ns / 22 mhz

* How long does it take to add and write
  1. 100ns
* HDo we need to include the sign extender logic when calculating the critical path for a processor
  1. Yes

#### Convert NS to Mhz

* ns/10 = Mhz
