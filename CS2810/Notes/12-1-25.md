## Exam 3 Review

### Single Cycle Design

* Combinational logic generates the next state memories (flip flops/ram) store the state. Clock transfer next state -> current state, and we repeat

* Next state: PC + 4
* State: Program Counter (Current Instruction)


### Instruction Fetch

* Keep track of the current instruction address

### ALU Operator (R-Format)

* Read data from the register (specify rs and rt)
* Do an ALU operation
* Write data back to the register file (specify rd)
* Remember we have our control flags that tells us if we are reading/writing/ALU operation.
* J and some I format instructions ignore the RegWrite input

### Putting it All Together

* ALU Operations
  * Load the instruction
  * Calculate next PC
  * Read the register file
  * Do the ALU operation
  * Write data back to the register fille

* Memory Access (Load/Store)
  * Load the instruction
  * Calculate the next PC
  * Read the register file
  * Calculate the address
  * Read/Write data from the data memory
  * Write data back to memory

### Control

* Mux selects the ALY input (register file or sign extended), and more
* Combines signals coming from existing componenets and decide which one is used.

* QUestion: What will the ALUsrc be for the addi instruction
  * 1

* What is the Shifter for in the branch path?
  * Each instruction is 32 bits. Our memory is in the words, 4 words.
  * Every instruction covers 4 words
  * Shifting by 2 you are always jumping by 4. Its faster and you automatically jump by 4

  * The ALU is used for testing equality. On a branch instrucion we subtract and see if we get the 0 flag
