# IEEE754 Review (I guess he taught us wrong?)

### Example 1 Postiive number
	* 2.625,
	* Exp = 3
	* Mantissa = 4
	* Sign = 1
		1. Find the binary representation 
			* 2 into 2.625 = 1
			* 2.625 - 2 = 0.625
			* 1 into 0.625 = 0
			* 0.5 into 0.625 = 1
			* 0.625 - 0.5 = 0.125
			* 0.25 into 0.125 = 0
			* 0.125 into 0.125 = 1
			* 10101
		2. Enter the Decimal
			* 10.101
		3. Scientific Notation
			* Move decimal
			* 1.0101
		4. Find exponenet
			* E = 1+3 = 4

### Example 2 (Negative)
	* -4.75
	* Exp = 2
		1. Find the binary representation
			* 4 into 4.75 = 1
			* 4.75-4 = 0.75
			* 2 into 0.75 = 0
			* 1 into 0.75 = 0
			* 0.5 into 0.75 = 1
			* 0.75 - 0.50 = 0.25
			* 0.25 into 0.25 = 1
			* 0.25-0.25 = 0
			* 10011
		2. Enter the decimal
			* 100.11
		3. Add your exponenet
			* 100.11x2^0
		4. Normalize by moving decimal over
			* 1.0011x2^2 (we moved 2 spots so now the exponenet is 2)
		5. Find Exponenet, exponenet + bias.
			* To find bias
			* E = 2 + 3 = 5
		6. Put it in binary
			* E = 101
		7. Find our mantissa (fraction)
			* 0011
		8. Find our sign
			* -
		9. Put it together 
			* Sign, Exponenet, and Mantissa
			* 1|101|0011 boom there you are

### Example 3 Extreme decimal
	* +0.40625
		1. Find binary representation
			* 1 into 0.40625 = 0
			* (Decimal) 0.5 into 0.40625 = 0
			* 0.25 into 0.40625 = 1
			* 0.40625 - 0.25 = 0.15625
			* 0.125 into 0.15625 = 1
			* 0.15625 - 0.125 = 0.03125
			* 0.0625 into 0.03125 = 0
			* 0.0325 into 0.0325 = 1
			* 001101
		2. Enter the decimal
			* 0.01101
		3. Add your exponenet
			* 0.01101x2^0
		4. Normalize by moving decimal over (move to most significant digit)
			* 0.01101x2^0 = 1.101x2^-2 (We mived 2 spots to the right so the exponenet is -2)
		5. Finx exponenet, exponenet + bias
			* E = -2 + 3 = 1
		6. Put E into binary
			* 001
		7. Find our mantissa (Fraction)
			* F = 101
		8. Find our sign
			* -
			* 0
		9. Put it together
			* sign, exponenet, mantissa
			0|001|1010000000000 (Fill in value first, then the rest with 0s)


# Convert Floating Point Binary into Decimal (The other way) (IEEE754 into Decimal)

### Example 1
	* 0|110|1011
		1. Find sign
			* + = 0
		2. Find our Exponenet (E)
			* This is our Fraction (F) in base 2 minus our exponenet in base 10
			* 110(2) - 3(10) 6-3
			* 6-3 = 3
		3. Find our fraction (F)
			* Take the mantissa and times it by 2^E
			* This is the fraction part so you use negative exponenets
			* 1011(2)x 2^3 = 0.5 + 0 + 0.125 + 0.0625 = 0.6875 - 8
			* 0.6875x2^3
		4. Add a 1 because you assume its there
			* 1.6875
		5. Now solve
			* 1.6875x2^3 = 1.6875 x 8 = 13.5 there you go bro ham

### Example 2
	* 1|101|1101
		1. Find the sign
			* - = 1
		2. Find our exponenet
			* This is our fraction (F) in base 2 minus our exponenet in base 10
			* 101(2) - 3(10)
			* 5-3
			* 2
		3. Find our fraction (F)
			* Take the mantissa and times it by 2^E
			* 1101x2^2
			* This is a fraction part so you use negative exponenets
			* 0.8125
		4. Add 1 to it because you assume its there
			* 1.8125
		5. Now solve
			* 1.8125x2^2
			* 1.8125 x 4
			* -7.25 there you go bro ham
