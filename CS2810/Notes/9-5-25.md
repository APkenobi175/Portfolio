# Boolean Arithemetic 

### Addition
* This is the foundation of boolean artihmetic
* 
* It works similar to decimal addition, exact same rules, but it is in base 2
* Computers represent integers using a fixed number of bits
  * for example lets assume n=4, always fill in the 0s so there are 4 bits.
* **How to Deal with overflow**
    * Ignore them
* Practice
```
  | 0101| 5
  | 0100| 4
--|-----|--+
  | 1001| 9 

  | 1011| 11
  | 0011|  3
--|-----|--+
  | 1110| 14 

```

## Hardware Application (Assignment 2)
* We are going to build an Adder
* in Assignment 2 we will build circuts

**Half Adder**
* The Half Adder computers single bit addition between two bits
    * We have A and B as inputs and then the Carry and sum as outputs
    * You have to use the gates you created in assignment 1
  
**Full Adder**
* The full adder computes single bit addition between three bits
* Think of the third bit as the "carry in"
* One of the building blocks of 16 bit addition
* can be built using 2 half adders

**Add16** (Ripple Carry Adder)
* 16 bit addition between 2 16-bit numbers
* We do not care about what the last carry bit is

**Inc16**
* Increments keeps track of increments 
* Out = in + 1
* Logism has a constant componenet you can use, 1*constant

### Subtraction

### Multiplication

### Division


### Signed numbers
* Signed numbers are numbers that have a negative or a positive
* In high level languages signed numbers are represented using the data types (short, int, and long(16,32,64))
* signed values use the left-most bit and that represents the sign so if its 0 its positive and if its 1 its negative
  * 0011 = 3, 1011 = -3
  * Remaining bits represents a non negative integer
  * -0 is just 0
  
**Twos Complement**
  * Twos complement of x: invert the bits and add 1
  * The negative form of x is just twos complement
  * twos complement of 0000 = 0000
    * **Method 1**
    * 1110 = 2
      * MSB (left most bit) = 1
      * We kknow this is a negative number
      * take the one's complement
    * **Method 2**
      * 1110 = 
      * MSB = 1
      * We know this is negative
      * we take our bases 
      * (1x-8) + (1x4) + (1x2) + 0
      * You are basically putting a negative sign on the left most bit
    * **Examples**

    ```commandline
    Convert these to two complements in 4 bits
    0110 -> (0x-8)+(1x4)+(1x2)+(0x1) =   6
    1100 -> (1x-8)+(1x4)+(0x2)+(0x1) = - 4
    1111 -> (1x-8)+(1x4)+(1x2)+(1x1) = - 1
    ```

**you can use two's complement to get subtraction for free**
