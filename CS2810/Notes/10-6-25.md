# MIPS Memroy

* $zero - always 0
* 

### System Calls

* Can get user input, send output to the screen
* Need to ask the OS to do something 
* syscall allows you to make requests of the operation system ("System call")
* view all system calls from (?) in mars

```MIPS
# Load the service number into $v0 to print value
li $v0, 1
# Load value you want to print
li $a0, 50
# execute the syscall as currently set
syscall
# Print new line
li $v0, 11 # print a single character
li $a0, 10 #ascii character for new line (same as /n)
syscall # print out the new line
# load value you want to print
li $a0, -20
#execute the syscall as currently set
syscall
```
* You need to load $v0 with the syscall you want to preform
* If you are printing 2 things like that you need to put a new line after
* ascii character 10 is new line
* To get a user input 
```MIPS
li $v0, 5
syscall
move $t0, $v0
```


### Branching

* 2 sections, data.text and 
functions

```mips
.data
message_equal: asciiz
.globl main


main: 
### main function

```

* $v4 means print out a string
* FUnctions aren't actually functions
* If you jump to a fuction its gonna continue after the function is over
* you have to tell the program counter to go BACK
