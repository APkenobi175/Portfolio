# logic Gates

### Why are logic gates important
* All computers can be built by combining AND/OR/NOT operations
* More simplified operations = Lower Cost and More efficient system
### What are Logic Gates
* Physical representation of boolean algebra
* Gate symbols:
  * OR, NOR, AND, NAND, XOR, XNOR, Buffer, NOT
### AND Gate
* Implements the and operations. (e.g. A AND B)
* If both are true, then good

###  OR Gate
* Implements the or operations. (+) (e.g A or B)
* Either can be true to execute

### NOT Gate 
* Flips em

### XOR Gate
* Exclusive or gate. 
* Outputs true if and only if one of the inputs are true, but not both

### NOR Gate
* Not OR
* Logical complement of OR, NOT A OR B

### NAND Gate - The universal gate
* NOT NAND
* Logical complement of AND
* NOT A AND B
* This gate is the unversal Gate
* You can turn any gate into this gate
* Example: 
  * Not(x) = xNANDx
  * AND(x,y) = NOT(xNANDy)
  * The output for NAND will be the opposite of the input. Example, if X is 0 and Y is 0 output is 1. If X is 1 and Y is 0 the output is 1 if both are 1 the output is 0
* Theorems:
  * NOT can be realized using NAND
  * AND Can be realized using NAND

### XNOR
* Not XOR
* Logical complement of XOR, NOT A XOR B


## Representing Arbitrary Functions
* Converting Truth table to boolean expression
  1. Only focus on the rows with an output of 1
  2. Convert each row to a series of ANDS and NOTS. **ONLY ANDS AND NOTS**
  3. Combine each intermediate expression with an OR

example:
```
!x * !y * z
